Troy who is in his 1st grade and is having a hard time learning how to count numbers from 1 â€“ 50. 

He asked his brother Gabriel to teach him how to count, but he requested to do teach it 5 numbers per line. 

His brother don't know how to teach his brother so he's looking for a friend who can help him. 
    Can you help Gabriel to do a program that can teach Troy to count numbers by printing it 5 numbers per line? 


If the number exceeds 50, the output should display "Number must be 1-50!".

 
Use while loop to display the numbers.
